2. A brief description:
   This project showcases a Collaborative Study Platform that bridges the gap between students, tutors, and administrators. It is designed to streamline study session scheduling, resource sharing, and user management, offering an intuitive and secure experience. Built using modern web technologies like React, Tailwind CSS, Firebase, and Stripe, the platform delivers a comprehensive solution for educational collaboration. It features JWT-based authentication for secure user access and uses TanStack Query for efficient data fetching. Robust dashboards for students, tutors, and administrators ensure smooth operations and user interaction.
